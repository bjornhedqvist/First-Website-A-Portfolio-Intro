> *A few notes on designs:*
> It was imprtant to me that the website was aesthetically pleasing when viewed on a smartphone browser. Before I made the necessary adjustments, the text had too much marginspace on the left an right, and it looked truncated to the middle. As a sort of digital business card, it seemed only right that it looked good when viewed on the go.
> I also very much wanted the image spacing in the ## About Me section and the header background to be relitive to the size of the browser, which took some effort, but I am satified with the result. When I adjust the size of my browser window, the `<h1>` and the background image expand to allow for a further look at the mountains, and the three images below find their own space in as much as the window allows.

Thank you and I look forward to your feedback!
